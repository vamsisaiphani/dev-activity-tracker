\# Developer Activity Tracker (Python CLI)



A command-line tool built in Python to track daily coding activity, time spent, errors faced, and key learnings.



\## Why I built this

I wanted a simple system to log my daily development work and reflect on progress over time instead of tracking it mentally.



\## Features

\- Add daily coding activity

\- Store logs locally in CSV format

\- View past activity logs



\## How to Run

```bash

python main.py
